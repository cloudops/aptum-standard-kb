Similar to other cloud platforms, AWS provides you with the infrastructure to run virtual machines. These virtual machines are referred to as **instances**. An instance is based on a pre-defined image called an **[AMI](aws-amis.md)**, which cannot be changed once an instance is deployed. Different sets of specifications are grouped together as **instance types**, which include the number of vCPUs, the amount of memory, and the default size of the root volume for the instance.

Instances are listed under the **Compute** tab of your AWS environment, in the **Instances** section.

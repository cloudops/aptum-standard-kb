Enabling remote management for a StackPath workload will make the consoles for the instances (VMs and containers) in that workload available.  Instance consoles will not be accessible until remote management is turned on.

### Enable remote management

1. Navigate to the StackPath environment containing the desired workload.
1. Click on the workload to see its details.  The *Details* screen will appear.
1. Scroll down to find the setting for *Remote management*.  Move the slider to the enabled position, if it is not already.

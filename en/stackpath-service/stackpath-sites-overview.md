**Sites** are the mechanism you will use to control the delivery of your content through the StackPath network.  This includes configuration of features available through the Content Delivery Network (CDN), as well as the Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Serverless Scripting.  A site in StackPath acts as a bridge between the front end, which accepts requests from your users and returns responses via one or more *Delivery domains*, and the back end, which does the behind-the-scenes work of obtaining the dynamic responses and the static *assets* from your server, called the *origin*.

This structure makes it quick and easy to improve your application performance, and also to apply settings uniformly to your static and dynamic content, all under your control.  The delivery domain will use your domain name for the front end, which increases customer confidence, eases administration, and assists with Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

StackPath provides *EdgeRules* to give you control over how requests to your site are handled.  StackPath has four pre-defined EdgeRules that can be enabled, and also allows you to create custom EdgeRules to meet the specific needs of your site.

EdgeRules are available only when the CDN service is enabled for a site.  

that inspect requests to see if they match certain conditions, and matching requests will have actions applied to them.

Required permissions

### View EdgeRules

### Predeined EdgeRules

#### Force WWW connections
#### Custom robots.txt file
#### Pseudo-streaming
#### Referrer protection

- **Force WWW connections:** redirect http://acme.com to http://www.acme.com.  Be aware that this would redirect http://portal.acme.com to http://www.portal.acme.com.
- **Custom robots.txt file:**  easily create and maintain a robots.txt file through the ui
- **Pseduo-streaming:**  Allows a client to specify a seek point in a file.  
- **Referrer protection:**  Allows you to specify a set of domains from which users will be allowed to connect from, as identified by the `Referer` header.  You can choose to allow empty referer headers. Requests not meeting these conditions will be blocked.

### Create a custom EdgeRule

The interface will present a text field for the name.  A condition type can be selected.  Upon selecting a condition type, the interface will display the options appropriate for the condition type.  Additionally, once a condition type is selected, the interface will display an action to select for the EdgeRule.  Depending on the selected action, the interface will show the appropriate options for the action.

### EdgeRule conditions

Conditions may use five different attributes for an EdgeRule.

- **URL:**
- **Header:**
- **HTTP method:**
- **Status code:**
- **Cookie:**

### EdgeRule actions

An EdgeRule may specify one of four general types of actions to execute when the condition is met.

- **Header rules:**
- **Caching rules:**
- **Redirect rules:**
- **URL signing:**

#### Header rules

1. Add response header
   - Added to response from CDN to end user
   - Put the header name into the Key field.
1. Add header to CDN
   - Add to request from user to CDN
   - Put the header name into the Key field
1. Add header to origin
   - Add to request from CDN to origin server
   - Put the header name into the Key field
1. Modify header
   - Modify value of existing header <- Where?  In the request?
1. Remove header
   - From where?  The request?
   - Seems like you can use this to replace the value in the header.

#### Caching rules

1. Cache
1. Do not cache
1. Never expire

#### Redirect rules

When the condition is met, returns a 301 Redirect to the specified URL.

#### URL signing

Not clear what happens here?

URL Signing policies allow you to restrict access to your content by configuring a "shared secret" with StackPath. This "shared secret" is used to apply an MD5 hashing algorithm on the URL to validate the signature supplied on the request. Since the "shared secret" is only known by the publisher and StackPath, URL signatures cannot be generated by unauthorized users.
